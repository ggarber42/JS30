    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const teams = players;  // apenas uma referencia
    console.log(players,teams);
    teams[3] = 'Lux'; // muda o original
    console.log(players,teams);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const teams2 = players.slice(); //faz uma cópia
    const teams3 = [].concat(players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const teams4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 90;
    console.log(person,captain);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({},person,{number:99}); //start with blank object, object to copy, properties to copy
    console.log(person,person2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
